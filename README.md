# To-do List App

The application is a command-line to-do tracker. It records our tasks into a text file, displays them as a list in the terminal, and lets us mark them complete.

The program interface will handle these three actions:

- Add new tasks to a to-do list.
- Remove completed tasks from that list.
- Print all the current tasks in the list.
